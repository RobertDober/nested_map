**N.B.**

This README contains the docstrings and doctests from the code by means of [extractly](https://hex.pm/packages/extractly)
and the following code examples are therefore verified with `ExUnit` doctests.

## Dependency

    { :nested_map, ">= 0.1.0" }

  `NestedMap` provides tools to treat nested maps (that came as a surprise),
  notably:

  - accessing nested values with a list of keys
  - flatting a nested map to a list of pairs of list of keys and values
  - nested merging

  ### Flatting


  iex(0)> flatten(%{}) # empty
  []

  iex(0)> flatten(%{a: 1, b: 2}) # flat
  [{[:a], 1}, {[:b], 2}]





## Contributing

Pull Requests are happily accepted.

Please be aware of one _caveat_ when correcting/improving `README.md`.

The `README.md` is generated by `Extractly` as mentioned above and therefore contributers shall not modify it directly, but
`README.md.eex` and the imported docs instead.
